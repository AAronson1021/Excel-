**1. Loading the Data, and cleaning the Data.**

```{R}

credit<- read.csv("CreditCards.csv")
head(credit)
str(credit)
#credit %>% select(-CUST_ID)----> when running it appears the column to be removed has already been cleaned from set.

# I decided to limit the range to 1000 for the sake of processing time. 
credit_new<- credit[1:1000,]
dim(credit_new)
head(credit_new)
```



**2. Performed K-means cluster analysis**


```{R}

# Part B

set.seed(1)

fviz_nbclust(credit_new, kmeans, method = "gap_stat")


# Part C and D

km.res <- kmeans(credit, 2, nstart = 25)
fviz_cluster(km.res, data = credit)


```
